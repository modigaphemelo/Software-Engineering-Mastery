# Track 01: Core Languages

*The fundamentals – speak the web's native tongue fluently. These four languages are the foundation upon which everything else is built.*

**Track Progress:** 🟡 In Progress  
**Estimated Time:** 12-18 months  
**Prerequisites:** None – this is where everyone starts.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this track, I will be able to:

**HTML**
- Write semantic, accessible markup without thinking
- Structure documents for meaning, not just appearance
- Implement forms, tables, and embedded media correctly
- Understand browser parsing and the DOM

**CSS**
- Control layout with flexbox and grid instinctively
- Create responsive designs that work everywhere
- Architect CSS for scale and maintainability
- Animate with performance in mind

**JavaScript**
- Understand the language deeply – quirks and all
- Write asynchronous code without confusion
- Manipulate the DOM effectively
- Know design patterns and when to apply them

**TypeScript**
- Add type safety to any JavaScript project
- Create complex type definitions
- Build reusable generic utilities
- Migrate legacy codebases safely

---

## 📚 Recommended Order

1. **HTML** – The structure (Complete)
2. **CSS** – The presentation (Next)
3. **JavaScript** – The behavior
4. **TypeScript** – The safety layer

This order builds naturally: you need structure before you can style it, behavior before you can type it.

## 🔗 Connections to Other Tracks

| Track | Connection |
|-------|------------|
| **[Web Platforms](/track-04-web-platforms/README.md)** | Browser APIs build directly on JS; understanding the DOM is prerequisite |
| **[Architecture](/track-05-architecture/README.md)** | Design patterns, system design, and security all assume language fluency |
| **[Development Practices](/track-06-development-practices/README.md)** | Testing, build tools, and package management are language-specific in practice |
| **[Specializations](/track-07-specializations/README.md)** | Frontend frameworks are impossible without core language mastery |

## 🧠 Notes & Reflections

As I progress through this track, I'll capture cross-cutting insights here:

- *HTML and CSS are declarative; JS is imperative. The shift in thinking is real.*
- *TypeScript doesn't just catch errors – it documents intent.*
- *The browser is the most hostile yet most ubiquitous runtime. Respect it.*
