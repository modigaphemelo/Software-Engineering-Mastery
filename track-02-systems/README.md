# Track 02: Systems Languages

*Performance, memory, and control. These languages let you touch the metal – managing memory, threads, and resources with precision.*

**Track Progress:** ⚪ Not Started  
**Estimated Time:** 24-36 months (take these slowly – depth matters)  
**Prerequisites:** [Track 01: Core Languages](/track-01-core/README.md) – solid programming fundamentals

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this track, I will be able to:

**C**
- Understand pointers and manual memory management completely
- Read and write systems-level code (OS, embedded, drivers)
- Debug memory issues like leaks and segfaults
- Appreciate why every other language exists

**C++**
- Master RAII and modern C++ (11 through 23)
- Understand move semantics and perfect forwarding
- Use the STL effectively
- Build performant applications with control

**Rust**
- Internalize ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes
- Write fearless concurrent code
- Leverage cargo and the ecosystem
- Build systems software that's both fast and safe

**Go**
- Think in goroutines and channels
- Understand interface{} and generics (post-1.18)
- Build network services efficiently
- Appreciate simplicity as a design philosophy

## 📚 Recommended Order

There are two paths through this track:

### Path A: Historical Understanding
1. **C** – The foundation (everything builds on C concepts)
2. **C++** – C with classes, then so much more
3. **Rust** – Modern safe systems programming
4. **Go** – Simplicity and concurrency

### Path B: Modern Focus
1. **Rust** – Start with ownership and safety
2. **Go** – Quick wins with concurrency
3. **C** – Understand what Rust is protecting you from
4. **C++** – Where the industry still lives

I'll likely take **Path A** – understanding the past to better appreciate the present.

## 🔗 Connections to Other Tracks

| Track | Connection |
|-------|------------|
| **[Core Languages](/track-01-core/README.md)** | Syntax and programming fundamentals transfer, but memory model is radically different |
| **[Architecture](/track-05-architecture/README.md)** | Systems programming forces understanding of computer architecture, memory, and concurrency |
| **[Web Platforms](/track-04-web-platforms/README.md)** | Node.js, Deno, and Bun are written in systems languages; WebAssembly runs them |
| **[Specializations](/track-07-specializations/README.md)** | Game dev (C++), embedded (C/Rust), performant backends (Go/Rust) |

## 🧠 Philosophical Notes

- C doesn't hold your hand. That's the point.
- C++ gives you enough rope to hang yourself – and also build a suspension bridge.
- Rust says "let me check your work before you run it."
- Go says "let's not make it complicated in the first place."

Each language embodies a different philosophy of safety, control, and simplicity. Learning all four will teach me *why* languages are designed the way they are.
